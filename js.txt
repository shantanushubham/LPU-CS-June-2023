1. Functions
  In JS, everything is treated like an object.
  Therefore, a function is also treated like an object, unlike any other programming language.

2. Objects
  In JS, a JS object is like a key-value pair, where the key is always a string, and the value
  can be any JS object.
  Python: Dictionary
  Java: Map<String, Object> // JS has a Map like Java also
  C++: ordered_map<string, object>
